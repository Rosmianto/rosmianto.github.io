Nothing more.</li>\n<li>Veteran. You are battle-tested, lots of technical scars embedded (nice pun!) in your face.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Group #1, enjoying their craft with Arduino, but not realizing that there are a whole world beyond Arduino.</p>\n<p>Group #2, too busy even to guide #1. They are in high demand, and they seemed to be always working on something.</p>\n<p>If I draw those two groups, maybe it looked like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/Untitled.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3494\" height=\"1000\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-xs.png 300w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-sm.png 480w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-md.png 768w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-lg.png 1024w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-xl.png 1360w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>They live in a different island. They have different activity and rules.</p>\n<p>Me myself, just stranded to the veteran island, so I know how it feels to live in both islands.</p>\n<p>The problem is, I got there by swimming, forcing myself to move the hard way. But something I know for sure is swimming isn't for everybody.</p>\n<p>Being a noob is both easy and difficult:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy because you have lots of tutorials for beginner</li>\n<li>Difficult because you have lots of tutorials for beginner</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You see the irony? Tutorials have been a blessing and a curse.</p>\n<h2>The Issue With Tutorials</h2>\n<p>I'm pretty sure you have followed a tutorial at some point in your embedded career. What you usually find?</p>\n<p>Prepare the breadboard ðŸ‘‰ follow the wiring connection ðŸ‘‰ copy the example code ðŸ‘‰ build and flash. Voila!</p>\n<p>Yes, there's some explanations (like Adafruit and Sparkfun tutorials, they're great!), but the nature of tutorial is to <em>guide you do something really specific </em>(like blinking LEDs or reading sensor), nothing more.</p>\n<p>Problem arise when you want to level up your game. You might search for more advanced tutorials, like \"how to use FreeRTOS\", and fortunately you can get that tutorial.</p>\n<p>You then search for even more advanced topic like \"how to set correct FreeRTOS priority values\", no tutorials.</p>\n<p>You search \"how to make performant multiple FreeRTOS tasks\", you ended up with multiple sources, a bit here, a bit there. There's no single tutorials that explains all.</p>\n<p>Yes, that's the reality when you leave that noob island.</p>\n<p>You need to understand multiple concepts at once to understand FreeRTOS priority values.</p>\n<p>You need to understand multiple concepts at once to make performant FreeRTOS tasks.</p>\n<p>It's like Googling \"how to build website like Facebook\" and gets frustrated.</p>\n<p>Building Facebook isn't a tutorial bruh.</p>\n<h2>Noob Island Inhabitants</h2>\n<p>They don't have tutorials for advanced topics so they do what they can. They make sub-par work, even though they use many advanced concepts. I've seen it with my own eye!</p>\n<p>For example, I've seen a junior engineer wanted to run multiple tasks in parallel using ESP32. Instead of using the good ol' FreeRTOS tasks, he used some random library on the internet, acting as a scheduler, and throw code into the scheduler.</p>\n<p>Well, to be fair, the code is working btw.</p>\n<p>BUT IT STUTTERS, LIKE A LOT!</p>\n<p>He wasn't aware that ESP32 has multiple core, and he wasn't even aware the framework provides xTaskCreate() to make tasks.</p>\n<h2>I Want to Help</h2>\n<p>There are definitely issues there, and instead of swimming by themselves to veteran island. I want to build a small ship to help noob island inhabitants cross the sea, and land safely at the veteran island.</p>\n<p>I know, it's just a small dream, but I believe noob island inhabitants also deserve a better experience, better network, better friends, that they can find in veteran island. I believe I have to build a transportation mode, a ship if you want to call it, to help people cross the sea.</p>\n<h2>My Small Ship</h2>\n<p>Here's my little ship (looks like a boat, for now):</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/ship.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"220\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-xs.png 300w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-sm.png 480w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-md.png 768w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-lg.png 1024w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-xl.png 1360w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Yeah okay, it's a boat, but eventually I want to grow this little boat into a little ship, then a little yacht, and (hopefully) into a cruise ship. Here's what I will do with the ship:</p>\n<p>For Noob Island to Veteran Island, I will help you cross the sea with my ship. Probably you will look like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/noob-vet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2852\" height=\"1000\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-xs.png 300w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-sm.png 480w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-md.png 768w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-lg.png 1024w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-xl.png 1360w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>And for Veteran Island to Noob Island, I will bring resources from Veteran Island, such as their Best Practices, their tools, their network, etc.</p>\n<p>Basically I am a ship captain crossing sea back and forth.</p>\n<p>For now, my little ship is a digital product you can buy right now. It's called Professional Firmware Development Guide, where I show you the workflow I used to build professional-grade firmware for my company and clients.</p>\n<p>If you are interested, you can check it out here: <a href=\"https://fwguide.rosmianto.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fwguide.rosmianto.com</a></p>\n<p>Your ship captain is signing out. See you later! â›µ</p>",
