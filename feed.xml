                <p>I need to reimphasize this:</p>
<p><em>Yes, Arduino is <strong>a toy</strong>. And by a toy, I mean Scratch-the-programming-language toy. Arduino is the Scratch of embedded world.</em></p>
<p>But can you use Arduino for industrial or commercial-grade projects?</p>
<p>The answer is also YES.</p>
<p>Before we continue, I need to make sure that Arduino can refer to many things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arduino Boards (UNO, Nano, Micro, etc.)</li>
<li>Arduino IDE (The program you use to type code and upload code)</li>
<li>Arduino Framework (The entire embedded software libraries so you can use <code>Serial.begin()</code>, <code>millis()</code>, <code>delay()</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Arduino Community (forum.arduino.cc)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, we're going to refer Arduino as the Boards and Framework.</p>
<h2>Why Did People Think Arduino is a Toy?</h2>
<p>Because like any other toys, Arduino does:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify a lot of things</li>
<li>Is cheap enough</li>
<li>Is easy enough to get started with</li>
</ul>
<p>Arduino literally has lowered the barrier to entry embedded world. Before this, you have to use complicated boards (do you know BASIC Stamp?) with¬†<em>weird¬†</em>setup and boring documentation.</p>
<p>From there, Arduino has been associated with fun and cool projects, sometimes even a literal kid was teaching us to explore Arduino (remember Super-Awesome Sylvia?), no wonder if people start thinking Arduino == Toy.</p>
<p>And you must understand, that ironically, Arduino isn't aimed for embedded engineers.</p>
<h2>Arduino Is Aimed for This Market Segment</h2>
<p>Arduino is designed to be used by hobbyists and artists. People with no embedded background. So those people can make interactive art projects without much knowing technical stuff.</p>
<p>Yes, I know that Arduino is now expanding their business and try to capture industrial IoT (with Arduino PRO series). But for the majority of their market, it's still hobbyists.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Arduino as a board is just another embedded board, just like STM32 Development Board. Which is perfect for embedded engineers to use for many applications, including industrial/commercial projects.</p>
<h2>You Can Use Arduino If You Only Do This</h2>
<p>By treating Arduino just like other embedded tools.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Arduino, in its core, is just an microcontroller chip with some external components. So you can use it safely by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enforcing high-standard embedded environments</li>
<li>Insanely good coding standard</li>
<li>Superb firmware architecture design (this one is very important)</li>
<li>Understanding the hardware limitation</li>
<li>Thorough testing and certification process</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, Arduino UNO contains ATMega328P. That microcontroller is actually a commercial-ready chip. So don't worry. Atmel (now Microchip) even provides automotive-grade chip of ATMega328P. Do you still think it's a¬†<strong>toy</strong>?</p>

<figcaption >You can get automotive-grade variant of ATMega328P</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Okay, What About Arduino Framework? It's Sub-Standard.</h2>
<p>Yes Arduino Framework simplifies lots of things. But saying it as sub-standard software is an insult.</p>
<p>Treat Arduino Framework like CMSIS or mbed framework. Problem's solved.</p>
<p>In fact, Arduino and countless libraries have been used, tested, reported, and fixed by hundreds or thousands engineers around the world. Ditching Arduino Framework to favor your own in-house solution is like ditching AES-128 algorithm to make your own cryptographic algorithm. It's a bad idea.</p>
<p>Now, to make Arduino framework more polished, do these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ditch Arduino IDE and switch to VSCode + PlatformIO</li>
<li>Start separating your code into logical module. We call this modular programming</li>
<li>Use useful C and C++ features (like classes, virtual function, polymorphism, or even std::function if you feel fancy today)</li>
<li>Write proper unit-tests and do proper testing process</li>
<li>Use static analyzer and advanced linter</li>
<li>Lastly, you have to learn how a professional, industrial, commercial-grade firmware are being done.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all you need to do to use Arduino for serious applications.</p>
<p>For the Point 6, if you are interested developing a better firmware, I made a paid guide where I show you the exact workflow I use to build firmware for my company and my freelance clients.

            <![CDATA[
                <p>There's a big gap in embedded world.</p>
<p>I observed that your experience in embedded is either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Beginner. Familiar with Arduino. Nothing more.</li>
<li>Veteran. You are battle-tested, lots of technical scars embedded (nice pun!) in your face.</li>
</ol>
<p>Group #1, enjoying their craft with Arduino, but not realizing that there are a whole world beyond Arduino.</p>
<p>Group #2, too busy even to guide #1. They are in high demand, and they seemed to be always working on something.</p>
<p>If I draw those two groups, maybe it looked like this:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/Untitled.png" alt="" width="3494" height="1000" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-xs.png 300w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-sm.png 480w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-md.png 768w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-lg.png 1024w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-xl.png 1360w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>They live in a different island. They have different activity and rules.</p>
<p>Me myself, just stranded to the veteran island, so I know how it feels to live in both islands.</p>
<p>The problem is, I got there by swimming, forcing myself to move the hard way. But something I know for sure is swimming isn't for everybody.</p>
<p>Being a noob is both easy and difficult:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy because you have lots of tutorials for beginner</li>
<li>Difficult because you have lots of tutorials for beginner</li>
</ul>
<p>You see the irony? Tutorials have been a blessing and a curse.</p>
<h2>The Issue With Tutorials</h2>
<p>I'm pretty sure you have followed a tutorial at some point in your embedded career. What you usually find?</p>
<p>Prepare the breadboard üëâ follow the wiring connection üëâ copy the example code üëâ build and flash. Voila!</p>
<p>Yes, there's some explanations (like Adafruit and Sparkfun tutorials, they're great!), but the nature of tutorial is to <em>guide you do something really specific </em>(like blinking LEDs or reading sensor), nothing more.</p>
<p>Problem arise when you want to level up your game. You might search for more advanced tutorials, like "how to use FreeRTOS", and fortunately you can get that tutorial.</p>
<p>You then search for even more advanced topic like "how to set correct FreeRTOS priority values", no tutorials.</p>
<p>You search "how to make performant multiple FreeRTOS tasks", you ended up with multiple sources, a bit here, a bit there. There's no single tutorials that explains all.</p>
<p>Yes, that's the reality when you leave that noob island.</p>
<p>You need to understand multiple concepts at once to understand FreeRTOS priority values.</p>
<p>You need to understand multiple concepts at once to make performant FreeRTOS tasks.</p>
<p>It's like Googling "how to build website like Facebook" and gets frustrated.</p>
<p>Building Facebook isn't a tutorial bruh.</p>
<h2>Noob Island Inhabitants</h2>
<p>They don't have tutorials for advanced topics so they do what they can. They make sub-par work, even though they use many advanced concepts. I've seen it with my own eye!</p>
<p>For example, I've seen a junior engineer wanted to run multiple tasks in parallel using ESP32. Instead of using the good ol' FreeRTOS tasks, he used some random library on the internet, acting as a scheduler, and throw code into the scheduler.</p>
<p>Well, to be fair, the code is working btw.</p>
<p>BUT IT STUTTERS, LIKE A LOT!</p>
<p>He wasn't aware that ESP32 has multiple core, and he wasn't even aware the framework provides xTaskCreate() to make tasks.</p>
<h2>I Want to Help</h2>
<p>There are definitely issues there, and instead of swimming by themselves to veteran island. I want to build a small ship to help noob island inhabitants cross the sea, and land safely at the veteran island.</p>
<p>I know, it's just a small dream, but I believe noob island inhabitants also deserve a better experience, better network, better friends, that they can find in veteran island. I believe I have to build a transportation mode, a ship if you want to call it, to help people cross the sea.</p>
<h2>My Small Ship</h2>
<p>Here's my little ship (looks like a boat, for now):</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/ship.png" alt="" width="501" height="220" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-xs.png 300w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-sm.png 480w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-md.png 768w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-lg.png 1024w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-xl.png 1360w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Yeah okay, it's a boat, but eventually I want to grow this little boat into a little ship, then a little yacht, and (hopefully) into a cruise ship. Here's what I will do with the ship:</p>
<p>For Noob Island to Veteran Island, I will help you cross the sea with my ship. Probably you will look like this:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/noob-vet.png" alt="" width="2852" height="1000" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-xs.png 300w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-sm.png 480w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-md.png 768w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-lg.png 1024w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-xl.png 1360w ,https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>And for Veteran Island to Noob Island, I will bring resources from Veteran Island, such as their Best Practices, their tools, their network, etc.</p>
<p>Basically I am a ship captain crossing sea back and forth.</p>
<p>For now, my little ship is a digital product you can buy right now. It's called Professional Firmware Development Guide, where I show you the workflow I used to build professional-grade firmware for my company and clients.</p>
